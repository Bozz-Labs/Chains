Ideas:
-Chain storyline

-Powerups, and items

-If sneak jumpscares you, you 
automatically lose one random 
item

-Nots look like sneaks until you get withis 2 ft

-Balances: Damage, powerups

-Nerfs: (%) chance of number of bug spawning per room

-Make sure that player has a functional tool bar, and health.
